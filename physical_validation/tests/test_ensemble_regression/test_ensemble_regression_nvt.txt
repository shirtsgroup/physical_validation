Analytical slope of ln(P_2(E)/P_1(E)): 0.01309088
After equilibration, decorrelation and tail pruning, 85.71% (858 frames) of original Trajectory 1 remain.
After equilibration, decorrelation and tail pruning, 88.71% (888 frames) of original Trajectory 2 remain.
Overlap is 44.8% of trajectory 1 and 59.7% of trajectory 2.
A rule of thumb states that a good overlap is found when dT/T = (2*kB*T)/(sig),
where sig is the standard deviation of the energy distribution.
For the current trajectories, dT = 10.0, sig1 = 218.1 and sig2 = 222.4.
According to the rule of thumb, given T1, a good dT is dT = 6.8, and
                                given T2, a good dT is dT = 7.1.
Rule of thumb estimates that dT = 6.9 would be optimal (currently, dT = 10.0)
