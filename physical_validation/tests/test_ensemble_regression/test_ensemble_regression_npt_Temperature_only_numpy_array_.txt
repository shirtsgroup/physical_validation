Analytical slope of ln(P_2(H)/P_1(H)): 0.01309088
After equilibration, decorrelation and tail pruning, 86.31% (864 frames) of original Trajectory 1 remain.
After equilibration, decorrelation and tail pruning, 99.60% (997 frames) of original Trajectory 2 remain.
Overlap is 86.8% of trajectory 1 and 68.5% of trajectory 2.
A rule of thumb states that a good overlap is found when dT/T = (2*kB*T)/(sig),
where sig is the standard deviation of the energy distribution.
For the current trajectories, dT = 10.0, sig1 = 185.9 and sig2 = 195.3.
According to the rule of thumb, given T1, a good dT is dT = 8.0, and
                                given T2, a good dT is dT = 8.1.
Rule of thumb estimates that dT = 8.0 would be optimal (currently, dT = 10.0)
