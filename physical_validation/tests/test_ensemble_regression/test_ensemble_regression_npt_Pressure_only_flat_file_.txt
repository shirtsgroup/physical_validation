Analytical slope of ln(P_2(V)/P_1(V)): -2.42930431
After equilibration, decorrelation and tail pruning, 76.72% (768 frames) of original Trajectory 1 remain.
After equilibration, decorrelation and tail pruning, 99.80% (999 frames) of original Trajectory 2 remain.
Overlap is 86.6% of trajectory 1 and 83.5% of trajectory 2.
A rule of thumb states that a good overlap is found when dP = (2*kB*T)/(sig),
where sig is the standard deviation of the volume distribution.
For the current trajectories, dP = 100.0, sig1 = 0.02 and sig2 = 0.01.
According to the rule of thumb, given P1, a good dP is dP = 324.6, and
                                given P2, a good dP is dP = 349.7.
Rule of thumb estimates that dP = 337.2 would be optimal (currently, dP = 100.0)
