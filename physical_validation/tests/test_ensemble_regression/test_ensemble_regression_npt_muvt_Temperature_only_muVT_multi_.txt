Analytical slope of ln(P_2(U - \sum \mu N)/P_1(U - \sum \mu N)): 0.00657226
Equilibration, decorrelation and tail pruning was skipped on user request. Note that if the provided trajectory is statistically correlated, the results of the physical validation checks might be invalid.
Equilibration, decorrelation and tail pruning was skipped on user request. Note that if the provided trajectory is statistically correlated, the results of the physical validation checks might be invalid.
Overlap is 95.2% of trajectory 1 and 60.9% of trajectory 2.
A rule of thumb states that a good overlap is found when dT/T = (2*kB*T)/(sig),
where sig is the standard deviation of the energy distribution.
For the current trajectories, dT = 5.0, sig1 = 331.2 and sig2 = 416.5.
According to the rule of thumb, given T1, a good dT is dT = 4.5, and
                                given T2, a good dT is dT = 3.7.
Rule of thumb estimates that dT = 4.1 would be optimal (currently, dT = 5.0)
