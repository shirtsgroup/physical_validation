Analytical slope of ln(P_2(E, V)/P_1(E, V)): 0.01309088, -2.34968083
After equilibration, decorrelation and tail pruning, 76.62% (767 frames) of original Trajectory 1 remain.
After equilibration, decorrelation and tail pruning, 78.12% (782 frames) of original Trajectory 2 remain.
Overlap is 85.4% of trajectory 1 and 83.5% of trajectory 2.
A rule of thumb states that a good overlap can be expected when choosing state
points separated by about 2 standard deviations.
For the current trajectories, dT = 10.0, and dP = 100.0,
with standard deviations sig1 = [222.1, 0.02], and sig2 = [229.8, 0.01].
According to the rule of thumb, given point 1, the estimate is dT = 6.7, dP = 6.9, and
                                given point 2, the estimate is dT = 324.2, dP = 345.9.
Rule of thumb estimates that (dT,dP) = (6.8,335.1) would be optimal (currently, (dT,dP) = (10.0,100.0))
