Note: Your muVT ensemble has more than one mu value. Ensemble check is implemented for
      * ensembles differing in T only, with any number of mu values
      * ensembles differing in one value of mu only
      * ensembles differing in T and one value of mu.

A rule of thumb states that good error recognition can be expected when
spacing the tip of the distributions by about two standard deviations.
Based on this rule, and the assumption that the standard deviation of the
distributions is largely independent of the state point, here's an estimate
for the interval given the current simulation:
Current trajectory: muVT, T = 300.00 K, mu = [-0.00 -37.50 -0.00] kJ/mol
Suggested interval:
  Temperature-only: dT = 4.5 K
  Chemical potential-only: dmu = [0.5 0.6 0.5] kJ/mol
