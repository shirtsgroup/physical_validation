Trajectory 1 equilibration: First 104 frames (10.4% of trajectory) discarded for burn-in.
Trajectory 1 decorrelation: 127 frames (14.2% of equilibrated trajectory) discarded for decorrelation.
Trajectory 1 tails (cut = 0.10%): 2 frames (0.26% of equilibrated and decorrelated trajectory) were cut
After equilibration, decorrelation and tail pruning, 76.72% (768 frames) of original Trajectory 1 remain.
Trajectory 2 equilibration: First 0 frames (0.0% of trajectory) discarded for burn-in.
Trajectory 2 decorrelation: 0 frames (0.0% of equilibrated trajectory) discarded for decorrelation.
Trajectory 2 tails (cut = 0.10%): 2 frames (0.20% of equilibrated and decorrelated trajectory) were cut
After equilibration, decorrelation and tail pruning, 99.80% (999 frames) of original Trajectory 2 remain.
Overlap is 86.6% of trajectory 1 and 83.5% of trajectory 2.
A rule of thumb states that a good overlap is found when dP = (2*kB*T)/(sig),
where sig is the standard deviation of the volume distribution.
For the current trajectories, dP = 100.0, sig1 = 0.02 and sig2 = 0.01.
According to the rule of thumb, given P1, a good dP is dP = 324.6, and
                                given P2, a good dP is dP = 349.7.
Rule of thumb estimates that dP = 337.2 would be optimal (currently, dP = 100.0)
Computing log of partition functions using pymbar.BAR...
Using 65.88726 for log of partition functions as computed from BAR.
Uncertainty in quantity is 0.01435.
Assuming this is negligible compared to sampling error at individual points.
