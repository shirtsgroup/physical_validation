Analytical slope of ln(P_2(U - \sum \mu N)/P_1(U - \sum \mu N)): 0.00657226
Trajectory 1 equilibration: First 92 frames (9.2% of trajectory) discarded for burn-in.
Trajectory 1 decorrelation: 41 frames (4.5% of equilibrated trajectory) discarded for decorrelation.
Trajectory 1 tails (cut = 0.10%): 2 frames (0.23% of equilibrated and decorrelated trajectory) were cut
After equilibration, decorrelation and tail pruning, 86.51% (866 frames) of original Trajectory 1 remain.
Trajectory 2 equilibration: First 11 frames (1.1% of trajectory) discarded for burn-in.
Trajectory 2 decorrelation: 0 frames (0.0% of equilibrated trajectory) discarded for decorrelation.
Trajectory 2 tails (cut = 0.10%): 2 frames (0.20% of equilibrated and decorrelated trajectory) were cut
After equilibration, decorrelation and tail pruning, 98.70% (988 frames) of original Trajectory 2 remain.
Overlap is 74.1% of trajectory 1 and 57.1% of trajectory 2.
A rule of thumb states that a good overlap is found when dT/T = (2*kB*T)/(sig),
where sig is the standard deviation of the energy distribution.
For the current trajectories, dT = 5.0, sig1 = 325.0 and sig2 = 411.8.
According to the rule of thumb, given T1, a good dT is dT = 4.6, and
                                given T2, a good dT is dT = 3.8.
Rule of thumb estimates that dT = 4.2 would be optimal (currently, dT = 5.0)
