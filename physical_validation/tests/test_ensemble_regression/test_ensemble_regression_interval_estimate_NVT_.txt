A rule of thumb states that good error recognition can be expected when
spacing the tip of the distributions by about two standard deviations.
Based on this rule, and the assumption that the standard deviation of the
distributions is largely independent of the state point, here's an estimate
for the interval given the current simulation:
Current trajectory: NVT, T = 298.15 K
Suggested interval: dT = 8.5 K
