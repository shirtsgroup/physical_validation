Analytical slope of ln(P_2(N)/P_1(N)): 0.20045393
Trajectory 1 equilibration: First 27 frames (2.7% of trajectory) discarded for burn-in.
Trajectory 1 decorrelation: 40 frames (4.1% of equilibrated trajectory) discarded for decorrelation.
Trajectory 1 tails (cut = 0.10%): 2 frames (0.21% of equilibrated and decorrelated trajectory) were cut
After equilibration, decorrelation and tail pruning, 93.11% (932 frames) of original Trajectory 1 remain.
Trajectory 2 equilibration: First 0 frames (0.0% of trajectory) discarded for burn-in.
Trajectory 2 decorrelation: 38 frames (3.8% of equilibrated trajectory) discarded for decorrelation.
Trajectory 2 tails (cut = 0.10%): 1 frames (0.10% of equilibrated and decorrelated trajectory) were cut
After equilibration, decorrelation and tail pruning, 96.10% (962 frames) of original Trajectory 2 remain.
Overlap is 94.2% of trajectory 1 and 77.2% of trajectory 2.
A rule of thumb states that a good overlap is found when dP = (2*kB*T)/(sig),
where sig is the standard deviation of the volume distribution.
For the current trajectories, dmu = 0.5, sig1 = 8 and sig2 = 1e+01.
According to the rule of thumb, given mu1, a good dmu is dmu = 0.7, and
                                given mu2, a good dmu is dmu = 0.5.
Rule of thumb estimates that mu = 0.6 would be optimal (currently, dmu = 0.5)

Uncertainty in quantity is 0.04098.
Assuming this is negligible compared to sampling error at individual points.
