Physical validation reference
*****************************

`physical_validation` is a package aimed at testing results obtained
by molecular dynamics simulations for their physical validity.

.. note:: We are always looking to enlarge our set of tests. If you are a
   MD user or developer and have suggestions for physical validity tests
   missing in this package, we would love to hear from you! Please
   consider getting in touch with us via our `github repository`_.
